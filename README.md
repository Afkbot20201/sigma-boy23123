Modernized Multiplayer Chess — v2
- Fixed selection + move freeze issues
- Adds Main Menu: Main / Create / Join / How To
- Player names are sent on join/create and displayed in lobby
- Server enforces turns and responds with detailed players list
- Frontend only allows selecting your pieces on your turn; illegal moves show a toast and don't freeze

Run:
> npm install
> npm start
Open http://localhost:3000 and use Create/Join from the Main Menu.
